# dotfiles :tada:

My dotfiles for bspwm, neovim, zsh, etc.

## Installing

First, you have to install Yay (or some other AUR helper).  
Then simply run `yay --needed -S $(cat aur.txt)` to install dependencies.  
I recommend creating symlinks to these configs, but do whatever you like.

You should also run `betterlockscreen -u .config/bspwm/wallpaper.jpg` to get the
lock screen working properly.
